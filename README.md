# Designing Data Intensive Application

We call an application data-intensive if data is its primary challenge - the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing - as opposed to compute-intensive, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.

# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality. Many applications need to:

- Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (**databases**)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (**caches**)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (**search indexes**)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (**stream processing**)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (**batch processing**)

Although a database and a message queue have some superficial similarity - both store data for some time - **they have very different access patterns, which means different characterstics**, and thus very different implementation.

There are datastores that are also used as message queues (Redis), and there are message queues with database-like durability guarantees (Apache Kafka).

If you have an application-managed caching layer (using Memcached or similar), or a full-text search server (such as Elasticsearch or Solr) separate from your main database, it is normally the application codeâ€™s responsibility to keep those caches and indexes in sync with the main database.

Stitching smaller systems together results in a larger data system, with different characteristics.

## Thinking About Data Systems

We focus on three concerns that are important in most software systems:

- **Reliability**: The system should work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows(in data , traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.
- **Maintainability**: People should be able to work on the system productively in the future.


## Reliability
* Continue to work when faults (NOT failure!) occur. We say such a system is fault-tolerant.
* Faults is defined as components of the system deviating from the spec while failure is defined as a system stop working entirely.
* It is impossible to reduce faults to 0; therefore, we should design a system that tolerates faults.
* Introducing random faults (as in Netflix Chaos Monkey) could improve confidence in fault tolerant systems.
* For security issues, we would prefer to prevent faults over tolerating them, as security breaches cannot be cured.

### Hardware Faults
* In the past, people use redundant hardware to keep machine/service running.
* Recently, platforms are designed to prioritize flexibility and elasticity. Systems can tolerate loss of whole machines. No down time scheduled needed for single machine maintenance.

### Software Errors
* Software errors/bugs are more systematic. They impact all machines in the same service.
* Alerts can help check the SLA guarantees.

### Human Errors
* Most outages are human errors. We can
  * Minimize opportunities for errors through designs.
  * Decouple where mistakes are made (sandbox) and where the mistakes causes failures (production).
  * Test thoroughly, including unit, integration, and manual tests.
  * Allow quick and easy recovery to minimize impact.
  * Set up clear monitoring on performance metrics and error rates.

### How Important Is Reliability
* Reliability is important for the business. Any down time could be revenue losses.
* There are situations where we may tradeoff reliability for lower development cost, but we should be very conscious when we are cutting corners.
