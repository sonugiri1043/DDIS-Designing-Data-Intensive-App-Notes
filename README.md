# Designing Data Intensive Application

We call an application data-intensive if data is its primary challenge - the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing - as opposed to compute-intensive, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.

# Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality. Many applications need to:

- Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (**databases**)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (**caches**)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (**search indexes**)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (**stream processing**)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (**batch processing**)

Although a database and a message queue have some superficial similarity - both store data for some time - **they have very different access patterns, which means different characterstics**, and thus very different implementation.

There are datastores that are also used as message queues (Redis), and there are message queues with database-like durability guarantees (Apache Kafka).

If you have an application-managed caching layer (using Memcached or similar), or a full-text search server (such as Elasticsearch or Solr) separate from your main database, it is normally the application codeâ€™s responsibility to keep those caches and indexes in sync with the main database.
